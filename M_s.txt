Hi,

I hope you’re doing well.

Just to clarify — I had already updated the status in the ticket comments and also informed you separately, since I was on the morning shift and couldn’t join the status call.
Thank you for passing on the update to the team on my behalf.

I also wanted to mention that I had completed two additional ad-hoc tickets last week, which were not included in the weekly achievement report sent to the client.

Going forward, it would be helpful if we could ensure that such ad-hoc efforts are also captured in the report so that the overall contribution from the team is accurately reflected.

Thank you for understanding.

Regards,
