SSO Integration in FastAPI – Migration Proposal from .NET

1. Introduction
This document outlines the proposed migration of Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication logic from the current .NET backend to a Python-based FastAPI solution. The purpose is to streamline authentication, enhance scalability, reduce dependency overhead, and maintain enterprise-grade security.

2. Current System Architecture
	•	Frontend: Angular
	•	Backend: .NET APIs (handling authentication and API endpoints)
	•	Business Logic: Python scripts (called via shell from .NET)
	•	Databases: SQL Server and Google BigQuery
	•	Authentication: SSO using Azure Active Directory (AAD) or other OIDC provider

3. Problems with Current SSO Flow
	•	Complex Flow: UI → .NET → Shell → Python is slow and fragile
	•	Tight Coupling: Requires changes in both .NET and Python for auth
	•	Maintenance Overhead: Two teams for .NET and Python logic
	•	Debugging Effort: Errors need to be traced across systems
	•	Slower Performance: Shell-based calling introduces latency
	•	Limited Extensibility: Hard to scale for new auth logic or users

4. Proposed FastAPI-Based SSO Architecture
FastAPI Will Handle:
	•	Authentication via SSO (OpenID Connect)
	•	Token/session generation
	•	User verification and role extraction
	•	Unified access to both SQL Server and BigQuery

Flow:
Angular UI → FastAPI Login → SSO Redirect (Azure AD/Okta/etc.) → Token → Access Protected APIs

5. SSO Implementation in FastAPI (Overview)
	•	Use Authlib to implement OAuth2/OpenID Connect
	•	Fetch tokens and parse user information (email, name, roles)
	•	Store minimal session info or JWT token
	•	Authorize requests based on session or token data

6. Sample API Endpoints
	•	/login: Redirects user to SSO login (Azure/Okta)
	•	/auth: Callback after login, processes tokens
	•	/me: Returns authenticated user details
	•	/secure/data: Protected endpoint with access control

7. Technology Stack
	•	Backend Framework: FastAPI
	•	SSO Integration: Authlib / MSAL (for Azure AD)
	•	DB Access: pyodbc (SQL Server), google-cloud-bigquery
	•	Deployment: On-prem / VM (No Docker if client restricts)
	•	Caching / Sessions: Redis or Python-based caching (optional)

8. Security Best Practices
	•	Use HTTPS for all API endpoints
	•	Rotate tokens periodically
	•	Use secure cookie-based sessions
	•	Validate issuer and audience in tokens
	•	Store no PII or tokens in browser/localStorage

9. Business Benefits
	•	Unified Backend: FastAPI handles both business and auth logic
	•	Cost-Effective: Removes dependency on .NET licensing/support
	•	Scalable: Easy to add more endpoints, integrate ML, etc.
	•	Fast: Async request handling ensures faster user login
	•	Easy to Maintain: Single language (Python) across backend stack

10. Migration Strategy
	•	Phase 1: Implement FastAPI with mock SSO endpoints
	•	Phase 2: Integrate Azure AD or other SSO provider
	•	Phase 3: Replace .NET auth endpoints in staging
	•	Phase 4: Validate session and DB access
	•	Phase 5: Go live and monitor performance/logs

11. Example User Object After Login
12. Future Readiness
	•	Multi-user concurrency
	•	Easy integration with logging/monitoring tools
	•	Flexible for ML model-based role checks or analytics

13. Conclusion
Migrating to FastAPI with native SSO integration ensures:
	•	Improved security and maintainability
	•	Reduced latency and complexity
	•	Enhanced user experience
This is a future-proof, scalable architecture aligned with cloud-first, Python-based transformation goals.
